                        <h6>Subject : Application for a junior developer position</h6>
                        <p>Madam,</p>
                        <p>I've just finished my final year of computer science studies at the Ecole Centrale de Lyon, a french engineering university which is usually considered among the top ones. I'm now looking for a job in that field, starting as soon as possible.</p>
                        <p>While school brought me a fairly good understanding of software architecture and design patterns, it's mostly through my two development internships that I turned it into skills.</p>
                        <p>My first one at MDP Qualité gave me a first overview onto the work of a front-end developer, and although we were using a closed source technology at the time, I'd love to transpose this knowledge for using with open web technologies. I've also been really interested in some recent developments on the front-end side lately, namely Javascript virtual DOM frameworks like React and tooling like Webpack and PostCSS. That's why I'm learning those at the moment.</p>
                        <p>My latest one, at Justwatch in Berlin, includes experience with restful APIs : working on the whole back-end for a new "actors and directors" functionality. It required me to add routes for the mobile app to fetch person information, but also to get this information from the web into PostgreSQL, and then into Elastic as a materialized view. These six months I've spent at JustWatch in Berlin have allowed me to strengthen my Golang and back-end development skills and to set a first foot in the startup world, which I absolutely loved. Since I'm looking for a similar job today, that's why seeing your company is hiring caught my attention.</p>
                        <!-- <p>Most of the experience I have involves back-end development. experience using golang : justwatch</p> -->
                        <!-- <p>Strong knowledge of Golang  internship + interest to continue working with this language because</p> -->
                        <!-- <p>javascript, css</p>
                        <p>strong desire to learn new technologies</p> -->
                        <!-- 
                        <p>Innovate New technologies found self</p>
                        <p>High level of english  work abroad, father</p> -->
                        <!-- <p>I am currently in my final year of engineering studies in one of the top engineering schools in France, the Ecole Centrale de Lyon, and I am looking for a six-month internship starting ideally in April 2015. The internship I am looking for would ideally involve backend development in Go, because I have enjoyed this language since I started using it last year. This is why why your internship offer on golangprojects.com caught my attention.</p> -->
                        <!-- <p>I also read about you very recently on TechCrunch, and I do think the approach of developing the legitimate offer experience instead of going after piracy can pay off, that’s why I believe in Justwatch as a startup and would love to be part of it. Of course, most of the experience I have in programming is general object-oriented programming and front-end development, and not especially backend specific. While it means I would still have to learn lots once on the job, I could not think of a more stimulating context to do so.</p> -->
                        <!-- <p>Also, since we currently have a technology watch to do at school on any news-related topic, I took this opportunity to learn how to use Docker and what benefits it can bring, so I was pleased to see that you use it as well.</p> -->
                        <!-- <p>I read about Typeform and some of its competitors more than once on Techcrunch, and because of the approach to make not just forms easy, but user interactions, Typeform seems like the company to bet on.</p>
                        <p>I read about Typeform and some of its competitors more than once on Techcrunch, and I really liked the approach of making user interactions easier, not just forms, and the idea of turning the product into a developer API. </p> -->
                        <p>I read about Typeform and some of its competitors more than once on Techcrunch, and to me both the Typeform.io API and aiming at making all user interactions easier and not just forms really make Typeform stand out. And i generally love companies who care so much about the user experience, that's probably is my most compelling motivation to work with you. As an additional one, Barcelona doesn't seem like the worst city to live in !</p>
                        <p>I’d love to learn more about Typeform and its future plans, the way you work, and my potential mission, so I look forward to speaking to you personnally.</p>
                        <p>Please find enclosed my resume. I hope my application will be of interest to you.</p>
                        <p>Best regards,</p>
